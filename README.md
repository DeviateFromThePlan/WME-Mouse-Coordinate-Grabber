# WME Mouse Coordinate Grabber
Press 'Ctrl+.' to grab mouse coordinates on the Waze Map Editor without additional clicks.
This script was entirely created by ChatGPT!!!!! The only thing I did was remove a JS alert and edit the metadata. All the actually functional code was written by AI!

Note: There have been some human edits since [V1](https://github.com/DeviateFromThePlan/WME-Mouse-Coordinate-Grabber/releases/tag/2024.01.10.01).

The Waze Forum for the script can be found [here](https://www.waze.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=402506).
